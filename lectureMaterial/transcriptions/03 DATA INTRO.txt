 okay so the last one I was telling you basically what works and now I'm gonna
 tell you what nots work because right now you are thinking right?
 Lixie you are looking like genius you show us line go up everything is perfect
 mom I will buy Lambo very soon I'm gonna tell you what the problem is okay so
 there's a lot of differing data right you've got a lot of different factors
 influencing markets you've got non-stationarity and I kind of start
 smiling when I say that but you've got to realize like non-stationarity meaning
 non-stationary someone sitting in a chair like I am right now stationary E I
 minus it stationary person someone running non-stationary meaning changing
 all the time right so what does that mean price in over the years and I'm
 gonna go to the monthly for this always changes if you look and it's gonna be
 like history of the markets right do you think that for example and if I
 plot a line yeah because this is a hundred and six right like follow my
 personal right here do you think that this when the market recovered 106 is
 the same in 2016 as it was in 2000 like right here quick trick question now
 inflation what happened after you know like 9-11 Iraq war you know these
 happened all around like here here I don't know probably all of other bad
 stuff 2008 of course happened right what do you think happens around all this
 time you know like basically this price won't even covered because after here
 they changed macroeconomic economic policies right we've had a little run
 up here and basically the summation of that is that it's non-stationary and
 the factors on this are war monetary policy inflation because 2% is the
 average per year anyway it always changes now it can be even worse than that
 because next to non-stationarity non-stat I'll just shorten it you also
 have noise in bars meaning noise to signal what would that mean you have a
 noise to signal ratio in this little bar right you have let's see a lot of
 compressed information this little month whoa this okay that's nice that's a
 nice trading few feature in this little bar there's a lot of information
 because this is a one-month bar meaning it opened and closed on the first and
 last values entered right if I think about how much data is inputted into
 that one data value like let's say you have a little Excel sheet right and you
 have your little rows right and here you have entry for month one of year month
 two of here month three it means that in every month there are 30 days and in all
 these days there are you know 24 hours times 60 hours but then start looking at
 let's say all these little bar all these little time frames right you have one
 second you have one minute right like every one day has 24 hours has 60
 minutes you know do you start do you start to see like how these data values
 in those Excel sheets can be treated right like I can have a one month data set
 of 30 days or I can have a one month data set of let's say you know 60 times no
 like 30 times a day but have it 20 24 hours respectively right which would
 give me 30 times 24 rows right so either I have 30 rows or have 30 times 24 rows
 or heck it can be even worse right like you can keep can keep multiplying now
 why am I saying that because I want you to kind of envision that data set if I
 start moving down to let's say the Juan minute data frame okay I move down I'm
 moving down right you see minutes here you have days okay so I'm gonna mark down
 this day the 6th to the 7th of October because that's that's what I'm filming
 this stuff you know I'm in the past and stuff you're not you're watching from
 the future so this is one day now I want you to envision right this is one day in
 that data set so I'm gonna make this a little bit bigger right and let's don't
 take this all too literal right but this is when the day opened right this is
 one that they closed so either I have 30 days in that data set that I just told
 you about and it would have O C H L and you know some some volume indicators
 that I've removed haha right so that's that's either one entry or I have 30
 times well this is a this is the minute bar it doesn't matter whatever right so
 you have here because I'm in the EU this is opening hour right here this is
 usually the most volatile period and then here you can already kind of see
 that because it opened here closed I can make another channel here make a little
 channel here channel here because it broke out channel you know you see how
 how price changes like per per time per per part of the day and then here at the
 end it actually becomes a little bit crazier again so aside from like this
 little breakout this little thing not much happens you know like here a little
 bit I guess but you know you see there's a lot more movement here and here and
 that's something very common actually around lunch which for the US I'm in
 different I think it's I guess it's probably around here you know middle of
 the day you see that this one candle that I could have had for one day has this
 much information a lot of these periods are different meaning one row in that
 excel sheet is not the same as the other which is creating what I said this
 noise to signal which is why actually modeling interday becomes very hard
 because you have to constantly kind of reassess what kind of environment you're
 in which is also what creates a very hard environment for discretionary
 trading right that's why if you compress this to only a O L H C you just
 create a more denser compression of info you know because then you're catching
 this whole thing in one information bar which is why for example if I now plot
 this back test you can see that it starts looking messy you know it starts
 looking bad it was looking good in the beginning and that's why I'm telling you
 it's bad because I knew what to show you these differences here along with
 other ones but this is the simple reason simple one that I want to give you is
 why when you start moving up and the noise to signal ratio becoming smaller
 makes back tests look better because the movements and the bar entries meaning
 also the bars entered here start looking more significant and are more
 significant and the measures of that of that autocorrelative aspect become more
 reliant because the values start getting smoothed out right like we're not
 smooth trying to smooth out values you know like the average of the last 200
 bars being you know like launch opening hour no no it starts being like 20
 lunches and no no it starts being 200 times lunch and 200 opening hours right
 and that's why when you smooth that out the values become more consistent and
 you actually start supporting the auto correlation that happens and it starts
 becoming the reason why suddenly oh this little equity curve oh it looks better
 we're gaining more we're gaining more okay okay what if I move up again you
 know this is why swing training becomes more consistent okay we're more gaining
 more again okay it's perfect profitable trades it's up it's up it's up you know
 it's why because then the data becomes more actually it actually starts
 supporting momentum effect and auto correlation factors and just by moving
 up in timeframes suddenly boom it's really good it's golden cross by the way
 so that's just a common use measure right but suddenly something like golden
 cross which is a strat that's used by like virtually everyone becomes very
 tradable right and it becomes doable on actually a lot of assets you know like
 it starts looking good on a lot of things and and that becomes the magic of
 supporting that auto correlated factor and why swing trading and momentum effect
 have such a strong synergy instead of trying to measure just over lunch and
 opening hour you want to be measuring 200 lunches and 200 moving 200 opening
 hours because then the values become more constant and the auto correlated
 factor of the momentum effect starts having a real contribution and that's
 why specifically for this I'm doing swing trading and it's also because the
 alpha decay due to a lot of volume right and liquidity which are all of those
 market microstructure factors they are so high that you cannot get alpha decayed
 like who's going to exploit you at the point that where you're trading in on
 daily interval it's gonna take like all of the Fang CEOs to decay or alpha it's
 what actually totally okay with putting one of my best systems out there which
 is this one by the way it this one has lasted me three years and I don't mind
 that in this course I'm going to be essentially giving away my alpha I don't
 mind because on these timeframes it's virtually impossible to do it there's
 many nuances to it some of you might you know be able to capture my logic and do
 it better improve upon it right and but there are some more techniques that we
 will start touching on you know like I'm rambling a little bit getting a little
 bit of topic but you start to see why making those data values more
 significant helps you know because you smooth them out you improve the data
 quality right by lowering the noise to signal ratios and it becomes alright by
 the way the non-stationarity it's in part dealt with because doing something
 like an average or using a mom kind of normalizes values right like when you
 divide something divide one value by the other they become normalized and when
 you're doing moving average crossing over which is what this is they cross over
 from each other and they're always in a range from each other making it a kind
 of a ratio more than anything which is why again candlestick analysis like
 discretionary trading would never work which is some of the ways that you can
 kind of combat these inconsistencies with price once you start moving to the
 ML domain though machine learning this becomes a whole different story but I've
 just explained you a problem with price but why we're on daily interval to
 combat just that now to start improving this same methodology now that we have
 you know done something very simple to improve data we can actually start
 improving the values and put it into these indicators the formulas behind the
 indicators are often something like is and or sorry Jesus Christ why am I doing
 that is something like n is to 200 and that creates a value of you know the
 average last prices now this one is okay it's 529 let's say right it doesn't
 really matter I don't know it's 200 yeah so it's 529 right and 50 is at like 580
 so 50 is 586 right so we're talking a lot about the improvement of data values
 now there's a lot of things that you are inserting into these TIs it's the raw
 input you know of these values but how do you improve this more well you can
 also change the inputted values right you can change 200 from 50 and when you
 start changing these the moving averages change and your entry rules because
 for this strategy for example when one moving average crosses over the other
 that is the buy or sell rule that's what you're going to program in and then
 you've created a little algorithm you know and by improving these values those
 values change because this one just became 598 and 25 you know so 255 98 and
 by improving these the results of your strategy become better or worse so by
 improving the raw input of data values but also improving the treatment right
 so it becomes like a production I show you the treatment of the value like for
 your buy and sell rules things change and then the total outcome of your
 trading changes you know like the actual decision making behind it and that's
 when things become interesting so how do you find you know the best combinations
 of these now that's where a lot of data scientific principles come in
