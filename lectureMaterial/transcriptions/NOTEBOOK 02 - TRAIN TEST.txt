 Alright, to continue notebook part 2. Alright, this little code block is the splitting of
 data. Why do you split data? Data is split for the reason that you want in-sample data,
 the training period you devised, and auto-sample data to test on. Why is this extremely important?
 Because you need to mock up real-time testing. If you don't do this, you might be over-optimizing
 values in the grid search. You have zero real life, like rolling forward, walk forward,
 proof of anything ever working, and you're gonna maybe lose money. Maybe not. You can
 make a very tight data split like basically this. You could split it to be like this. Do
 you see how these dates are changing? The training date and the validation set become
 very tight. This is a little more than a year. I think it could work on lower volatility
 assets, but it really depends how you judge a certain data set. In this case, it's Bitcoin.
 I prefer being conservative with this because as you will see later, even with very good
 modeling, with a very good ensemble, the drawdowns will still be pretty high even in cases such
 as how do you put it? The max drawdown will be very high because of the general exposure
 to market. That's also why the returns are high. When you go intraday and you start
 sizing positions more, you do limited entries. You start using stop losses. You can limit
 these things a lot more, but it's at the cost of total returns and you have to monitor
 a lot more. There's a lot more chance for alpha decay. There's a lot more cases that
 can cause drift. This adds a lot of consistency. I would recommend in general a 0.6 split,
 meaning 60% of data being basically your trading period and then 40% of testing because it
 gives you a lot more material to compare to in real life testing. It's also the best
 mock-up of how I did it in the first life years of trading this particular method where
 I basically never had anyone invest money in my strategies before I personally verified
 it to be strong for three years running. In this case, anything 0.6 or 0.7 give or take,
 this is also technically all right, maybe 65. These are all right periods. 65, that's
 the whole year. Right around there, I think are fine periods to do so, but because this
 is BTC and I do prefer telling people to be a bit cautious, I think 0.6, at least for crypto,
 so you can really verify the consistency and the generalization, generalizational ability,
 the general, how well it generalizes, Jesus Christ, I have lost my word wizardry. Damn,
 okay. Okay, so coming to the next code log, the triple EMA crossover grid search training set.
 This section performs a comprehensive grid search optimization for the triple EMA crossover strategy
 using only the training data. So that's of course what's defined here. The goal is to find the optimal
 EMA 1, 2, 3 combination that maximizes the sharp ratio on unseen data. So the unseen data would be
 and its ability to generalize well, where I just went into spaghetti with my words, strategy logic,
 by when any EMA crosses above another EMA 1 above 2, 1 above 3, or EMA 2 above 3. That's something
 I've used in the past. You can change up the logic depending on what you're trying to do. I'm
 going to sound like a broken record, but it's very important to understand if you have an asset that
 doesn't trend as well, you might need different logic. That's why understanding the particular
 indicators that you're using is pretty important, right? So again, gold, more choppy, more sideways
 actions, you might need like by rules that are more like by when RSI value is, you know, 80.
 Sorry, sell something like this, right? But you can look that up in your own time, because,
 you know, in this case, we're doing trends. So here are parameter definitions, a grid search,
 we talked about this, it's going to be doing a test of every combination. So here we are giving
 ranges for it to look, you know, so we have EMA 1, which is the shortest moving average, right?
 It's going to be the most snappy one. It might be the most noisy one, because it's the shortest one,
 right? So it's going to be smoothed out a lot less, but it's still a very important
 component of it, of course. You're going to give it the shortest ranges, you see that these ranges,
 they're not connecting. A little trick that you can do, which is important to keep in mind going
 forward, is that you can, you see these steps here, right? Like the way these lists work,
 it's going to give you the indicators from 4 to 40, 50 to 90, 120 to 250.
 We were talking about computation in the beginning. This one's going in steps of one,
 as you can see here, right? In the print, again, prints very important, four, five, six, seven,
 eight. If I make this a scrollable element, you see how EMA 3 is going 120, 123, 126,
 d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d. Right? It's going in larger steps.
 Something you can do in grid searches is something like a more wide param search
 and a narrow param search. So what you can do, given, okay, let's suppose, right, you have a very
 shit PC and you have no idea if your strategy is working, you could widen these values a lot, do
 like five to three and to two. And you could widen these values a lot, right? You could make this
 like 80 because you have no idea where the exact right value is, right? Because what a grid search
 will be doing for you is finding the ideal data values. Now, the ideal value of EMA 1 might as
 well be 60, right? So maybe in Dream World, this value is 60. Now, if you're running these grid
 searches between 4 and 40, I really hate these suggestions. It's giving me, come on, man. What the
 hail cursor, come on, man. Okay, so 60. It's 60. Stop suggesting me things. So in your Dream World,
 you are searching between 4 and 40. But because you haven't done a wide param search, you don't know.
 So it's better to like, let's say, widen the range and make it like 4 to 80 and start searching in
 steps of 30. And then when it approximates around 60, you can then narrow the param search. And all
 it would take for you is to restart the notebook, run again, and you can just play around with the
 parameters. So your first run would then be like 480, and then do it in like steps of two or four,
 depending on how great amazing your PC is. Obviously, if you have a really very killer gaming PC,
 because you used to be addicted to a Counter Strike 2, because come on, CSGO is way better,
 but they killed the optimization, then you can do that differently. But if you want to do like a
 wide search, and obviously, because the steps are bigger, the matrix computations, you know,
 like it's going to run faster, you can make better approximations, and then you can do more precise,
 narrow searches. It's a lot about expanding the exploration space of the parameters and making
 the grid search combinations lesser, but wider, so that it computes faster. And then once you know,
 because obviously, if you go in steps of two or four, it's going to be like all these, right? And
 then maybe it at the end of the grid search, it finds an ideal value of like 68. But maybe the
 perfect value is that say 67. So then you can, you know, make the make it a range, right? So let's
 say it's 67. So then you would kind of, you know, square it, you would put in a value 50, and about
 65, and start looking in ranges of one. And then it can approximate or find the exact value better,
 but you're saving time on running these grid searches. Because trust me, obviously,
 having 36 values here, 40 here, and like 130 here, it's times times, right? So it's 36 times 50 times
 120, you know, that starts adding up really fast. And because it's a brute for your search,
 meaning it's looking for every value, it can become computationally heavy, very fast. And anyone who's
 done machine learning knows that then, you know, it's going to take a whole long, whole,
 whole, whole ass long time for you to find anything worthwhile. And it might not even be good, right?
 Like if your algorithm, if the rules you've set up for buying, selling, computing, the results are
 very unoptimal, you might get results with very bad sharp ratios. And your grid search might be
 useless. And it's pretty shitty if you, you know, we're looking for that stuff all night,
 and then you wake up, you're like, fuck, yeah, I want to make some money. I want my BTC algo to be
 like real good. And then you come and the sharp is like 5.5, you know, like, your sharps are not
 good, man, no, this is not fun. Right. And I mean, this is probably not going to happen, because I
 am basically giving you something that works very well, and is quite consistent. And I'm also
 giving you a lot of indicators here that are pretty solid, by the way, like RSI, if you buy
 above 50 below stock RSI to do these are very solid, I have tested them, like they're pretty
 strong, right? Like MACD, pretty solid VWAP is something very widely used even at hedge funds,
 shaft rencival, I have worked with this, it's also a very strong indicator. But still, when you start
 switching assets, because you want to diversify that portfolio a little bit, because you don't want
 to be building only algos for tech stocks, it might become a little tough, right? So that's
 something to keep in mind. And once you start to reiterate
