 class is in session welcome you've come to the I don't know the core of it I
 guess right anything before this has purely been like me basically going M&M
 rep got on like basically a lot of concepts that I have you know internalized
 over the years yada yada yada you know obviously a lot of that is natural to me
 I'm teaching for a first time ever I do probably realize that I'm going over
 topics very fast but it's an ongoing thing you know you're here now you you
 know paid to see the material if anything is vague send me a message if
 needed low hop on a discord call I'm all down for that because that's you know
 the offer you know I'm trying to teach I'm new to it so you know obviously a
 veteran university professor might be a bit more broad at the same time I think
 information nowadays can be given in a lot shorter more compressed
 fashion that makes it easier to understand in a sense and I do believe
 personally speaking at least that a lot of things can also be covered way too
 much when a lot of these things can be common sense that I'm gonna stop stop
 yapping blah blah blah prologue done okay so this is the notebook this is the
 notebook I'm going to give you can see on the top here there's a bit more stuff
 going on right there's a little bit more at the back of it you can see here for
 example BTC ensemble that's what I was talking about before you know where you
 combine technical indicators the way I've set at least set this up for the
 time being is a very simple version because it does need some reiteration
 right when you start building and you start building algorithm you start
 building any kind of trading strategy it's never going to be perfect from the
 start I've talked about the idea of like super scientific of course of throwing
 shit at the wall see what sticks that's really a lot of stuff you're going to be
 doing you're gonna make an assumption and then you need to prove it it's
 actually you know kind of documented in science too because you're never gonna
 have this perfect intuition so you need a notebook that you can kind of
 reiterate over redo stuff as you go so I'm gonna go through the notebook I'm
 gonna start explaining why things are the way they are the way I've set it up
 this notebook I will be attaching so people can look at it blah blah blah
 maybe use it and I'm going to be explaining how you could in your own
 efforts and me helping as much as I can realistically and how you then can
 create your own unique version of algorithm to yeah basically make your
 own strategies and compose a portfolio so for beginners sake obviously the
 language is Python Python is the best language ever because you can import a
 ton of libraries it's all open source there's infinite use cases like the way
 you have to look at programming it Python is the perfect language for many
 cases because libraries allow you to import basically any tool in the world
 an example would be vector VB which is like a backtesting module that can
 automate thousands of lines for you to reliably test strategies I've enjoyed
 using it so far you can also make your own but if you're not like you know
 sufficiently a depth at code this can give a lot of confusions and only cost
 you to make mistakes if it ain't broke don't fix it is my motto MO I tried
 building my own backtesting module often sometimes they produced results I
 like but for something that I have to kind of trust in the case that I want it
 to be right now I tried cost referencing with TradingView cross it's not like
 TradingView has the perfect metrics but I tried to mirror at least the results
 but they were so off that I decided to go for factor BT and it's been totally fine
 for at least application in the sense that I was wishing for it to be in this
 course material okay so PIP install in whatever VS code version you've got
 that respectively there it might be PIP 3 install no exclamation mark install
 blah blah blah these are the libraries used why finance TA live for technical
 indicators non-pi for basic mathematical operations pandas for data frames etc
 data storage factor BT for backtesting and ski B for statistical purposes math
 bloodlib for chart charting yeah for charting yeah visualizations okay so
 here why finance is used I'm using why finance for this because it's freely
 accessible and you don't need like an API key you can get a rate locked if you
 download too much there are better APIs if you have an API key you can use like
 alavavantage you can use data bento they give you some free credits there's many
 different ways to do it but for all purposes for daily interval if you go
 below you want to construct something more advanced you're gonna need other
 data brokers like that that bento or alavantage but for the at least the use
 case of this course why finance is honestly fine definition of ticker of
 course in this notebook we're working with Bitcoin start date is 2018 0101
 as I've you know described in the the part where I'm describing basically how
 to have that soft way of looking at data but looking for those accompanying
 stress tests to you know find a training period that is suitable for the
 algorithm you would want to create ideally here of course is just some code
 to you know download blah blah blah print it out here you can see the print
 of the data I've made the case for vibe coding blah blah blah what is very
 important is that you always have displays prints you know that's what
 this is to really check the data frame the data set blah blah blah whatever
 kind of results you're trying to create so that you can actually curate what's
 happening extremely important I have seen it in the discord that people will
 if I can maybe display that they'll have no no no not like this with they'll have
 giant code blocks kind of look like this and then they go control C control V
 and they try to edit whole codes like this without breaking it up if you look
 at this notebook everything is broken up carefully with print so you can
 actually know what's going on if you don't know what's going on under the
 hood and you're not breaking it up in parts the orchestration of your whole
 notebook is simply going to suck it's going to be bad if you're going to
 vibe code don't turn it into a giant black box where you don't know what's
 going on in between obviously I'm not using VS code here I am using cursor
 because it makes a lot of work a lot faster and in a way better because I can
 use a giant fucking LLM that's been trained on petabytes of data though it
 requires me to break things up even more so I can actually cure it code now
 this is some simple code but let's say you stop using vector BT to make your
 own backfester you really have to go check line by line much you would like
 code normally but to make sure that things a you actually understand what's
 going on so that you can actually explain it to people so it's like
 demonstrable and very reproducible in other cases so you don't like lose
 money but you you know you can check you know what you're actually getting is
 what you're looking for so you really want to take care of that organizing a
 notebook of course also really happens like this you want to carefully
 orchestrate breakdown for you know function sick but also to read it back
 yourself you know it's going to be painful if you're working with someone
 they're gonna be looking at it but also just for any other use case you really
 want to do that so please avoid that I've seen people do it don't do it I saw
 people in master degrees do it don't do it please for the love of God okay so
 coming to the second note block here this one it's with TA lip it's defining
 the columns it's here calculating moving averages exponential moving averages
 MACD RSI stochastic RSI VWAP it's all the manual calculations for them
 shaft trend cycle and creating the data frame accompanying why okay so basic
 basic warning I have added a lot more indicators in this notebook here than
 I'm actually using it's the way I build is I start small and then I expand right
 like I could be grid searching a lot more stuff in this notebook but it can't
 becomes computationally heavy I'm working on a MacBook a grid search in this
 case what I'm doing is very it's brute-forced right so it's doing all
 matrix calculations all at the same time for every combination possible there's
 different ways to grid search you have randomized grid search and grid searches
 you have Bayesian grid searches you can even start doing genetic programming
 it's stuff I'm going to be looking looking into later but it's not important
 right now that could either be like a Bayesian is computationally better but
 if you have like not as strong hardware you kind of have to start understanding
 also that your computation has limits but also from you know the kind of
 software engineering perspective you can't just you know come like complete
 every matrix calculation if you simply make it too big it comes up a few more
 times but also for the construction of code sense if you start building super
 broad super big from the beginning in your in your own notebook and you're new
 to constructing things and it becomes over engineered from the beginning your
 and you're not orchestrating it correctly breaking up the code properly it's
 going to be a mess but also for customizability sake for this notebook
 because I'm going to be giving what this one you also see this one BTC MacD
 this one it's obviously using different values 3ma it's a triple exponential
 moving average and this one MacD obviously is another indicator it's
 already provided here I've also put in other ones RSI stock RSI stochastic
 meaning VWAP what what else is here a shaft trend cycle I also included
 yeah yeah STC right so the purpose of this course and this notebook is not for
 me to just give you all the tools that's a little bit silly I'm trying to teach
 you something through practice and iteration of yourself on your own
 initiative and talking to me to kind of like find your own way of learning it to
 construct an algorithm right I'm giving a triple exponential moving average
 notebook away for free to look at and kind of play around with and maybe
 reorganize I am providing other indicators in the notebook but the
 intention of it is for you to start playing around with right because like
 we've discussed the treatment of data differs a lot depending on how you
 treat it the triple exponential moving average obviously is three very simple
 averages with an exponential at the end with for the later data values when you
 start looking at a MacD the math behind it already come becomes very different
 with an RSI it's like average gain divided by average loss a shaft trend cycle
 actually already becomes like very mathematical and every
 formula therein is very different so of course the results when you start grid
 searching and backtesting become very different so what the amalgamation of
 what I'm trying to tell you becomes is that you start throwing a lot of these things at the wall
 no like in application I think it's all very simple but it requires you to play around with
 a lot of these factors right the ideal and scenario is that you start creating notebooks for yourself
 with triple exponential moving average with macd with RSI with VWAP with shaft trend cycle
 and you start seeing which ones of them work the best in the ensemble the algorithms that I've
 made and shown before like the Tima the T-MacD the ones that you saw in the previous video that I
 was showing on TradingView that's an ensemble of the triple moving average that you see in this
 notebook and the MacD because it's T E M A C D wow that's a mouthful right those two I tested
 but what are you gonna do there's like 90 100 you can even make your own technical indicators
 right and their individual treatments of data are very very very very different and they're all
 going to give you different scores different ensembles and that's also like a nice way for you to make
 your own algorithm and trading style or I mean it's not your trading style right it's your algo
 method something right and you're going to find different ways of applying them that's why this
 is a perfect made-in project it's algorithmic trading you can do it over different timeframes
 and you can start seeing differences I've talked before about like mean reversions for maybe like
 gold right I've got it somewhere here it's right I'm running a grid search here for gold
 just to give like some case studies and show people kind of the differences of the certain
 indicators right because trend indicators like I've said don't work as well as other ones
 for certain assets I have specifically been looking at well trending assets like you know a lot of
 tech stocks are and a lot of cryptos are but if you want to model for gold because you want to hold
 a less volatile asset you're going to have to use different indicators and that's why I've included
 them here in this case because why is this happening because you need to start playing around with a
 lot of these so that's why they're here that's the intention so you can so you know they're in
 the notebook they're ready to use you can remodel it you can start you know vibe coding over here I
 do really recommend cursor blah blah blah but you can edit around the notebook to have a different
 indicator but in this case there's the triple exponential moving average
