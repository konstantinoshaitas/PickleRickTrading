 Hello and welcome to my first personal Rick theory video. There's multiple of them
 but this one truly is like a word or something that I made up okay. This paper
 I've been referring to it and on YouTube earlier in the course it's it's
 something I sent to people when they're new to algorithmic trading because for
 me this paper really shows how effective certain how do you say it technical
 indicators really are how simple they can be how effective they are it's
 actually you know breaking down the market with simple timing you know like
 buy above sell below because that's what this paper really does and it does it so
 perfectly over a hundred years back test I mean almost right like 92 blah blah
 blah blah right and 2025 I've tested it myself it looks about the same but the
 basic premise that I find reading this and obviously you should but and what
 fascinates me is the fact that basically a lot of these boomer sayings that
 you cannot time the market they are wrong you know but to be fair the trend
 is your friend it kind of is right until it's not okay so time it okay but it
 lays bare such a powerful amazing thing that is called you know trend
 following of course but it's the one that also this is displayed very well in
 this paper and that is that the volatility in downtrends is much shock
 here than it is in uptrends right okay let me remove these wrongs okay so to
 show you what I mean right like because in the chart and to have a feeling for it
 and and you know because I can tell you wanting one time in the videos and as
 short as I'm trying and you know as you go on and follow me on the journey of
 creation creating the first quant portfolio for you and investing in that
 for your lifetime is that as you revisit topics you kind of build your
 relationship with them right like you get a deeper understanding of them yada
 yada yada you can read the same book every year you're gonna understand it
 better and I really believe in something called like there's risk-taking
 there's risk reduction but then I also believe there's like intelligent timing
 of risk to explain that you have to kind of look at this chart and then also
 realize like how smooth this looks and how choppy this looks right like I'm
 trying to kind of draw softly but like you can see how choppy all those down
 movements are and that's because here under the 200 and under the 150 how well
 they are you know deciding these regimes these trends you can see that the
 volatility is much higher right so imagine and that's that's what I'm
 trying to say right is that intelligent risk exposure exists and that's
 something I build on right like you want to be intelligently exposing yourself
 to upsides of market with low volatility because the trend or at least how do
 you say the characteristics of a healthy trend are low volatility up trend
 meaning markets going up because that's also displayed in a bull bear cycles
 market it's it's also stocks it's displayed in these charts right like the
 market tends to go up there is a left screw of the normal distribution right
 markets tend to go up it's why I think the method that I'm giving you is very
 quantum mental meaning you can stock pick personally and it's going to work for
 the same reasons why buy and hold buy and hold of the S&P works like the market
 tends to go up except this method allows you to time it in a robust
 intelligent fashion and perhaps even leverage on parts of the market that
 are better for it right like because that's the exact point of it it's why I
 have the triple Nasdaq right here it's because of this paper if you can somehow
 cut out that ugly downside and be in a low volatility uptrend with strong
 momentum right and there's going to be more parts coming up where you can also
 like build relativity factor models to you know filter through there's more
 papers of that there's going to be infinite content on this in this school
 anyway but if you can expose yourself to all of these smooth periods in the best
 way possible and have long exposure to them it starts justifying the use of
 leverage it starts justifying that you could model high beta asset meaning
 something higher than the beta one coming from the S&P and only exposing
 yourself to the upside of them which only magnifies your your returns in
 magnitude the one most damning statistic in this whole paper is the one where it
 still maintains this 92 year back test but instead of like this one where it's
 the S&P 500 times 3 and the fucking liquidation rate of like happened happens
 and will happen like it's guaranteed is the one where they're using the 200 ma
 to cycle in and out which is here right the S&P 500 3x 200 day leverage rotation
 where the max drawdown is only 51% compared to the one where their triple
 leveraged here but almost getting killed or double except here they're
 rotating and it becomes lower than a double one so you could literally take
 the assumption from this it's a 92 year back test so this is not overfit it's
 robust it could work all the time anyone can run this you don't need to code for
 it you can just set an alert from Tradingview it quiet literally in its
 fundamentals and it's not like the best-sided paper but who is going to
 argue a 292 year back test you can't do it right this is one of the easiest ways
 that you can expose yourself to these extremely high beta strategies but
 still be you know surviving and living to tell the tale and you will have gained
 more money because newsflash the volatility also just stays right around
 the same and the annual return is 40 24.2 and then when you have a strategy
 that is is so good that it reduces the risk so much better than the 200 ma
 because you're building on strong data scientific principles that are you know
 robust enough where even if I start adding in like let's say because the
 trading period like we have this discuss right it's 2018 2022 I start adding
 boom this period here the decay as you see here it's barely there yes trading
 view calculates differently but the sharp ratio Sortino they barely change I
 just added eight years out of sample they are not decaying this proves the
 methods that I'm giving you are so robust that it basically becomes as
 effective and robust and non-overfit as this 200 ma but still will allow you to
 triple leverage things right if you look at the returns of this look at it it's
 4.7 22% with a max drawdown of 35 that's a back test of 15 years mind you that
 is extremely significant that is super high right this buying hold return is
 quite ridiculous too but the drawdowns are so much lower trust me you do not
 want to sit through those drawdowns I actually think that if I because that's
 a bit of a faulty statistics there I think does this one go back to just
 right about let me see right yeah this one does go back to that that metric
 right so let me see right like let's let's test that because that one was
 trying to suggest that the strategy would not outperform but if you then
 expose yourself to a major crash like 2008 2020 here do you see how nicely it
 exits because a 200 a man I've tested this many times it does survive these
 drops right because it's so well you know accustomed to exit trends right as
 they happen right I'm scrolling past it never mind okay look it exits in 2008
 to and this is totally out of sample here I mean I mean here but so even in
 these flash crashes it's it's surviving right so you can survive long enough over
 these periods and still have like such strong draw drawdowns max equity drawdown
 and you can expose yourself to them and it's so strong and it justifies the use
 of leverage on them by the way this is an unleveraged product the debt on the
 TQQ is not strong but okay look so my point is it exits so strongly and then
 when you you know apply a similar methodology you can recreate this and
 then when you start once you start mixing in like different assets because what I
 said right it's also you can how do you put it you have different assets that
 you can expose yourself to like in a fundamental sense right like because
 what you're doing really is just hedging yourself from downside and you could
 leverage yourself into upside magnifying returns on those healthy trends like the
 the positive momentum preferably higher up momentum uptrend and low volatility
 now then what you get when you never you know a set of side the fundamental
 analysis side of things is that you can start diversifying over assets which is
 something that will also be covered soon enough in this school course which is to
 start mixing in things like BTC you start mixing in the TQQ you start mixing
 in something like Apple you start looking for assets that are still you know
 have enough beta but are in different industries like maybe a 3x gold or 3x
 Dow Jones industrial average these are just examples because they obviously
 have to become modeled and I'm going to start modeling them and I'm going to be
 displaying that with you right like because the idea here is for you to
 start creating a portfolio kind of with me maybe become better than me me to
 help you blah blah blah blah all idealistic and cool and stuff right we
 all want to buy a house we have a tough economy nowadays right but as you take
 that and you you have these these assets you have one two three four because
 there's also a lot of fundamental analysis like traditional finance that
 a lot of people don't know right you have portfolio management theory where
 often they'll have an asset they'll buy and hold them but they want the returns
 to be uncorrelated let's say this asset gains like this this one is like quite a
 reverse right this one gains like this this one is like kind of really weird
 like this and did it it and we give them like correlation scores like this one
 and you're gonna be comparing all of their correlation scores this one has
 0.4 this one might have like 0.8 this one might have 0.2 this one will have a
 correlation score of 0.8 so it's incomplete reverse and this one let's
 say minus 0.6 now an asset that has extremely high correlation to all and
 this is of course not a real example but something with high correlation to
 everyone is the least preferred asset for you to hold something with a super
 low like a negative correlation to everything is something you can offset
 right like if you hold all tech and tech goes down that means your whole
 portfolio goes down if you're holding an uncorrelated portfolio then you can
 balance that out right it's more likely for you to break even at the end of the
 day of like a big swing on the market now let's let's add more more components
 on top of that right you you build preferably a portfolio that mostly
 consists of assets that are very negative like this or at least the lowest
 correlation desirable so usually they would do this with buy and hold assets
 you know though what you can also start doing is to deploy simple algos on right
 so you can start having the return curves from the buy and hold measure the
 correlation but then also start adjusting them with you know certain buy and
 sell points like here here here and here right and these get their own return
 curves now this adds diversification on diversification and also much like the
 ensembles where the TI's the TAs right were correcting each other signals if
 there was a false or delayed signal now strategy one will be correcting
 downturns with strategy two so together then you can be more likely to break
 even or gain more money as long as you can pick that asset which is also why I
 was trying to kind of give you that soft intuition for spotting good assets to
 hold right and there are infinite assets to find right so that's something that
 I'm also going to probably do more longer form videos on but you know this is
 the bootcamp this is the get yourself in my brain part of all this but once you
 you you you get enough understanding of my weird brain we can start using your
 weird brain and we might be able to pick some crazy stuff right like let's see
 this one this is the website fun egg fun egg has basically financial analysts
 employed from Amsterdam because they are a Dutch company and also in New York
 they have all these cool ETFs right they have these cool strategies you have
 dividend mining China rare earth materials high as region semiconductor
 yada yada yada right like they're quite famous for some of these ETFs but let's
 say we want something with high returns because we are young and we want to have
 a family and stuff and we want to buy a house and we are in a tough economy higher
 risk asset can scroll down I believe they have an overview of their teams usually
 okay it's not important right now why invest wait okay no never mind okay no no
 I was on such a good flow talking there wait give me a second guys ETF
 overview this this page is a little bit different than the other ones okay so
 let's say we have semi conductors because I know this page is more common than
 the ones I've worked out so you can see somewhere they have holdings fund page
 yeah okay that's what I was looking for so what they have okay here they have the
 holdings right so this is still tech but wait I can actually investment ideas
 strategies quantum you have to go to the front page apparently just bear with me
 as I'm booming around hello fun page did they make this one already please
 investment ideas okay whatever real estate income portfolio for man this is
 annoying what is this trying to be smooth here come on okay so let's pretend
 that this is not tech for a second right like let's suppose this is electronics
 financials maybe they do have this fine asset classes thematic investment teams
 financials fallen angels Europe okay genomics that's that's a nice one but
 what a love of God man give me the fucking holdings come on it's not so
 here we go fund page my god okay so finally medical robotics and
 bionic engineering so that's clearly something different than tech right so
 where I was talking about you having to have some other uncorrelated assets that
 will break even you start getting into the territory of different sectors right
 so you can start looking at different ETF websites like product offers like fun
 egg or direction of course there's an investment goal there's wisdom tree
 wisdom tree is also very good actually wisdom tree ETFs they are very alright
 they have a cyber security ETF which is still tech of course but the the correlation from
 main tech like big big big tech like apple microsoft is still going to be big
 enough to the point where I would deem them to be modelable and still have
 strong trends because that's kind of what they are as you can see here they have
 a lot so that's also like an option to go by when I make this post I'll be sure
 to like kind of like start assembling some websites that are cool to like pick
 assets from right but as you start modeling and stacking these different
 diversifications everything becomes more robust right so the point of these
 ETF websites is not necessarily to model the ETF but find the underlying
 companies right because then when tech goes bad we might want to be holding a
 company like metronik intuitive surgical striker at work at words life
 sciences model these and then have consistent strategies that are not
 overfit robust workout of sample but also in their underlying patterns of
 price are strong if you have those with high potential that are fundamentally
 sound right because if you pick them from fun egg or wisdom tree why are they
 good they're good because they've already been pre-picked by career
 professionals we're just adding a little bit of flavor on top like nothing here
 I'm saying is crazy it's just kind of like a strong plagiarization of it you
 know like why fix the wheel if it wasn't broken in the first place that's kind of
 what I'm getting at right like maybe if I look at this one asset it's actually
 quite interesting to look at metronik now okay this one would require some
 interesting modeling it's been a bit wild but I think yeah maybe with an RSI
 something mean reverting it could be doable right but if you keep stock
 picking across this you find things that are close enough maybe in sub sectors of
 tech because tech does tend to rise very nicely right you could also like
 consider maybe more mature companies like let's say coca-cola the company the
 problem with coca-cola though is that they're a very mature stock and the
 the return would be like lower so that would be like less ideal in some cases
 I think is this right okay it does have a very healthy trend for a few years this
 is a crazy opening by the way but yeah this something you could leverage kind
 of right like if you could and it depends on your broker your region I know
 that a lot of guys are also Indian you know so I've heard that in India you
 often can only trade the Indian assets so they are really going to have to find
 the underlying 50 find the highest beta ones find the ones that have these healthy
 curves and I do believe that the nifty actually has a very high potential to be
 modeled it has very strong trends actually yeah I think the nifty maybe maybe a
 liver leveraged version of the nifty exists because obviously the way I'm
 putting it up right now there's a lot of like American aspects to it I might be
 molding Apple soon right but let's say the the the docs you know like Germany
 Deutschland maybe this is a strong option given the trends are pretty good I think
 I can Europe has a stagnant nature and I would agree I think here but let's say
 China maybe the China a 50 okay that's also a little bit crazy but that's how
