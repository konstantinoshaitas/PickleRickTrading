 Okay, welcome to the how to pick training data training periods part of the
 shebang I'm making. Okay, so this is actually a very nuanced topic because the
 training data you pick is gonna make or break everything right if you think
 about it and it's similar right like machine learning trains on basic
 patterns right like you're if going right isn't good I have to go left if I go
 left a lot I get attacked in a dark forest so I first go left then go right
 and this becomes much more complicated as you go but obviously as pattern
 training happens in any kind of algorithm with any kind of considerations
 and numbers being generated it's extremely important that same as
 overfitting and generalization it's very important what the entries is
 because bad input becomes a bad output in practical terms and in this case too
 of course it means that knowing what data you have is very important we
 already discussed noise to signal ratio non-stationarity so there are some
 assumptions you can make you also have to kind of know and think about what
 kind of pattern you want to create right like do I always want to avoid certain
 dead going left do I want to live by going right again or do I want to go
 left left because for some reason there's like sunshine and rainbows but
 then killer killer bees come right like do I want to enjoy myself before the
 certain doom or do I want to keep leaving keep living but I'm in northern
 Europe it's cool here blah I don't know something like this right so in this
 case and it has to a few arguments and it's why it's the proposed one and the
 desired ideal period for the current year in my honest opinion is somewhere
 around the start of 2018 to ride about 2022 and to the middle of 2023 these
 periods for multiple assets have some major corrections and have some
 different ones but I'm using crypto right now as kind of like an example
 because it's got a big one in this case at least for crypto there's some case
 studies right you have a big bear market I don't know if people are as read into
 crypto as I am watching but the big bear market of 2018 2019 happened right
 here you can see that like there's basically not really I mean okay sure
 there's something happening but there's in comparison to here and here there's
 almost nothing happening right like this was called a bear market for crypto
 there's a lot of like these sideways channels not much happening 200% in
 this time of crypto is actually I don't know kind of mid if you start looking at
 like let's say these gains and how quickly those appreciated going up it was
 you know not nothing like crazy as like this boom mark like this is what they
 call the bull market this is like a slight rise up but you know this is a
 down period it had some different volume profiles some different volatility
 profiles but most importantly it also had a big bull market in the period with
 which gives it like basically two states of market to train on but also
 something that's called a stress test where the market had a very strong
 correction so if you stay in the trend of like what pattern you want to choose
 and learn from there's multiple big corrections that happened that can help
 pattern of emergence like an emerging pattern that we want which is to exit
 trends as they end right so like here here and you have some different volume
 profiles so you have another examples for autocorrelative patterns to happen
 like in momentum effect but there's also those sudden shifts that can help
 train the example of you know certain doom we need to exit our position and
 that's kind of like something you need to go by thinking about these things in
 this case there's multiple of these stress tests going down it's a healthy
 example of data which gives it something good to go by if you start looking for
 example and this has some other ones NASDAQ if you look here there's a
 stress test three of them but for example if you start looking at pre 2018 data
 like right here this is some fucking nail work here it's a lot up you know like
 there are some like corrections here but there I mean this is a bit wild what
 happened here but overall compared to these this period I would say it's much
 more smooth right like this one it's very compressed there's a lot of big
 shifts happening and you can train on some recent data so you're also like
 kind of accounting for the non-stationarity of things recent data
 with a lot of stress that's tests that happened that can give you that good
 auto-correlative pattern that is the momentum effect but also gives the
 models and things that you are grid searching a good idea of when to exit
 while here it's mostly up the market corrections aren't as decisive like when
 you start comparing them they really aren't as extreme start looking at this
 it's very mostly a very smooth line up and it's mostly going to be and this is
 also documented in most of the literature and news reports at the time
 that it's mostly an upmarket so if you're going to be kind of creating a bias of
 mostly markets going up you're training the wrong pattern which is why in this
 case the option for this was like the choice for this personally by me at
 least was not made then you have the out-of-sample data that also needs to
 be a healthy period of course but that's why we're splitting in a 60 40 70 30 in
 this case let's see now there's of course a lot of differences in data there
 is also data that doesn't really show healthy trends at least data that looks
 kind of like this does not have or has significant trends enough to train and
 see the autocorrelative factors on that can help produce the output of numbers
 that you want to have in a kind of algorithm when they start looking a
 little bit more like the Dow Jones where it's a little bit more sideways now
 here this is very choppy meaning like the NASDAQ actually pretty much gains like
 wait this is wrong no look the NASDAQ gains very healthily up you know like
 here it's up a little bit down up a little bit down up a little bit down up a
 little bit down big down big up while here there's a lot of sideways action and
 it actually makes the Dow Jones something very hard to model at least in
 respects of of trend following right like this barely anything happening and
 it's also a bizarrely different profile of volatility than most other parts of
 the market so here you would almost need like a Markov model anything to decide
 the regime and it makes modeling a lot more difficult at least for trend
 following purposes because you can't really like here you could do a mean
 reversion system with it maybe an RSI with certain buy points at 80 and 20 but
 you know you need to do it a lot more and the returns aren't even there the
 period of like that up period that I mentioned before I think it looks a lot
 more healthy but still I think it's it's not as smooth and there's another one
 that kind of has the same pattern that's gold this one is also at least for in my
 opinion kind of like notoriously hard to model because it just look it just has
 these crazy channels that last for for years this is yeah this is this here in
 it's had its most historic rise of its most historic rise in like I think what
 I read in news history like in the last like multiple decades at least like 50
 years or something like if you look at the history of gold here the biggest
 rise in like ages has been in 2024 like look at this this is like one big
 channel here that lasts from 11 to 20 and then yet one little breakout and then
 you have this one like that you can't model this if you had you would have
 been modeling mean reversion and you would have been like just weirdly
 trading this whole year that had its biggest gains you know like gold is
 not something you do trend following on it's just not that asset it's just that
 in the last year because there's been a lot of war and countries getting
 fearful like you might as well have a fear and greed indicator for gold
 basically because that's the basis of gold gold gets by it when people are
 scared of wars that would have been the like the best way to trade this but
 no we want healthy trending assets like Bitcoin NASDAQ other types of indices
 and that's just not really going to work and that's really how you can do
 simple soft analysis of charts to look at it there are definitely analysis is
 analysis types you can do with like volatility profiles maybe even use an
 ML cluster I'm actually thinking of creating those in the future but just
 for show of a swift scanning like soft eye scanning this would do and naturally
 the results you would see in in simps in sample and out of sample testing but
 that's something we're covering later right because when you start test testing
 in sample and out of sample you're looking for metrics like numbers one
 to three to not suddenly become like eight nine ten right you want one two
 three to become like one point two one two point two right you only want like
 slight degradation from one day to set to the other instead of like heavy
 changes happening because we are in trading by like a regime changing algo
 we only follow one regime which is the regime that goes up that's the that's
 the one right like we're trading by a up down methodology not like a slightly up
 slightly down slightly a big up big up big up big big down like this needs
 Markov modeling this needs more more math than I'm trying to teach right now
 right it's more complicated so that's the bottom line of that basically and by
 kind of looking at charts like this it's also going to help you select assets
 better right because the support of like doing fundamental investing and
 basically the system that I'm teaching you is going to be supportive of
 essentially also fundamental picks like let's say you think Apple still has like
 hello growth in itself you can model it and as long as you can kind of see that
 there's healthy trends up there's not like excessive channels now okay there's a
 bit of a channel here but these swings they are big enough that they can kind of
 be models otherwise the model will tell you in like consistent win rates and
 stuff that it's not but then you might have to use a different indicator you
 might have to use you know other tools but as long as there are healthy trends
 and you can swiftly see healthy trends and like I see a little bit of a channel
 here but then it's big up big down big up by kind of training your eyes to have
 this soft scan you can find suitable assets to then you know be hard about
 right because I'm talking about a soft scan here I like not to be you know I
 try to be quant
