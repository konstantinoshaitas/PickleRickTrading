 Welcome to the next sanity check. This one is with some charting. I think the
 visual checks are also very important. They're very important to start
 understanding. The first one would be the one of the rolling sharp. Obviously this
 is full sample so these sharps here and the rolling sharp ratio by the way
 obviously is a rolling forward changing and the average value obviously is
 somewhere in the middle here right so you'll be seeing like an extremely high
 rolling sharp somewhere here in you know the training period while here it's
 going to be slightly lower because obviously it's unseen data. Obviously
 still keeping in mind it has to survive and spend as little time under zero as
 possible. In this one I can definitely conclude that it's going to be spending
 some time under zero in its heaviest drawdown period right here and it's
 going to be having its drawdowns kind of here on this equity curve and there
 are some here like you cannot prevent obviously because it's markets. They are
 going to be drawing down but you can kind of see that it's upkeeping staying
 above at least 0.5. Well it's surviving even touching as high as two and you can
 conclude here that it's surviving decently well even in these heavy periods. Obviously it's going
 to be touching negative sometimes but the time spent under zero is extremely minimal even under
 these heavy drawdowns that to be fair are quite heavy but hey it's crypto what can you do really.
 I think this is a little bit of a okay check. I would not take this one as serious as like the
 average value and one that comes after because it's much about the consistent trades being taken
 making the casino your advantage right. Like I would not really dismiss something really based
 on rolling sharp unless it's spending like let's say 60% of its time below zero but then also the
 average value would obviously be super bad but maybe there is something alarming here sometimes.
 Send me some screenshots when you make a notebook and we can definitely look at it together.
 And hop in a call if needed. This one very important visual check regarding the minimal trades per
 year. Here you really want all these buy and sell signals to be very well spaced out. You don't want
 like let's say like these are chopping periods by the way so it's always going to be like this but
 you want them to be spaced out right because we are doing trend following so what you want is
 for it to catch these movements adequately at least you know and from this one I would say it's
 not over or under trading too much unless it's a choppy period but if you would see that it starts
 trading on in the trends it's going to be exiting much too early or too soon right. So
 a little bit of indecision in these sideways movements here honestly like okay this is the
 bear market like you can barely see it because of like the way of obviously the curve comes
 percentually but if it was over trading like here here here that would be a big red flag because
 then it would be making limitations for big swings and because we are swing trading we want to follow
 trend you really want to keep in mind like is it catching and exiting before these swings adequately
 right like we want to catch those big swings up like here here here and we don't want it to be
 indecisive here because then it means that this grid search result would not really be ideal at all
 you know and that would basically mean that maybe your max drawdown is very low because I've seen
 that right if you have some kind of algo or result or decision that got created from the grid
 search with a very low max drawdown but it's also being like timed in a way that it's exiting here
 exiting exiting like let's say it's and in this case it happened it's that it could be exiting
 prematurely meaning it's not catching those big moves and if it's not catching those big moves
 you're not trend following properly right this is kind of like a soft analysis thing and it's
 revealing you're going to have to develop that by going through these tests but if you're not
 catching the big swings you might be kind of trading on a mean reversion but that's not the
 point here right we want to follow trend so if you're not catching those big swings and your max
 drawdown is super low you have an algo or something that is exiting prematurely which is limiting
 your returns severely right you only wanted to exit here here here uh you know at the end of those
 huge moves and if it is you are probably over trading if it's uh you know catching the whole swing
 even down you're under trading right so that's the balance you want there and that's something
 that's going to have to be in your mind as you are deciding on a minimum amount of trades or a
 max amount of trades because you have to kind of you know you have to the grid search can do a lot
 of work for you but you have to lead it in the right channels if you see that the max drawdown
 and returns are both very low then you're over or under trading um being that if it's under trading
 it's going to be doing so little trades that it's basically buying holding that means it's you're
 taking the swing up but you're also taking the train right down so you're under trading so you
 basically buying holding so what's the point close the notebook just buy the asset and walk away
 from the computer but that's not what you want to be doing obviously I assume uh okay this little
 equity curve ignore it honestly it's not really that great uh the one that I think is super important
 is this one okay um here and I definitely want to um have this little uh table here too but I see
 that this easing is a little bit off okay it doesn't matter we can scroll if we need um so total
 trades plot at 30 so that's about uh how many years is this eight yeah so it's about four per year
 win rate 46 decent enough for one of the ti's you know the technical indicators average win 51.5 oh
 wait actually the metrics are here too oh you fucking retard um sorry also the smartest man in
 the universe can make some mistakes you know I'm only right 98% of the time guys sorry um so win rate
 46.7 14 wins 16 losses very good uh average win 51 percent average loss 6.25 minus max win max loss
 obviously the ratio of average win versus max loss very beautiful if this is so a big like this one
 but what you want to be mining here is that you are consistently gaining a lot more right like
 20 is all about small wins small wins small wins small wins small loss small loss big win big
 wins small loss small loss small loss small loss big win medium win small loss small loss as long
 as your losses are always small you're winning at least 50 45 percent of the time and the average
 meaning like the profit factor obviously is so high and the the the games per trade are so good
 that you're consistently always gaining meaning you're going to be compounding successfully
 meaning you're playing that casino effect your algo is good basically because this is only one ti
 as soon as you introduce an ensemble you're going to be correcting making each other more robust
 you're going to be enforcing a positive bias to have those casino trades basically I guess that's
 a term I can start using for it then you're going to be doing very well in markets that's the uh
 heuristic I've always gone by it's a very healthy heuristic uh I don't think uh you're allowing
 yourself much space if you have let's say a win rate of like 30 percent and an absolutely high
 average win rate because what if it the case now in this case obviously because we are testing 40
 percent out of sample the robustness is going to be very high actually the values could obviously
 be more optimal if the trading period was more recent and stuff and tested on more data but we're
 going for robustness if at least the robustness is prioritized by having a sufficiently large out of
 sample split like 40 35 percent it means that out of sample we are surviving and if then we start
 on assembling and we are still so robust because we have a large trading split we can well do believe
 and with enough evidence proven uh we can start live trading and we will be consistently gaining
 money because we will have devised a well enough uh heuristic for ourselves that we will keep uh
 stay consistent in live trading for years to come that's what I've gone by that's how I've traded
 this life for three years and that's what you need to get in your mind obviously when you start
 doing this I want you to communicate and send me screenshots I need to judge them and I need to see
 what you're doing I can only yap as much um obviously the practice and logic has to come from
 yourself eventually uh as a some time some day in the near future you have to become
 a rick less morty and but you know I hope I can imprint this message somewhat I'd like to show a
 final result of an ensemble this one it's uh is it the same matrix 10 okay it's not exactly the same
 doesn't matter uh it's close somewhat not really this is uh something I optimized maybe not even
 optimally but this is an ensemble right so this is a full sample test of two um
 two ti's put together trading full sample meaning uh you know a full forward test both
 together uh proving that combining indicators together is very strong and very solid at beating
 the benchmark so total return is 7 000 annualized 72 sharp ratio absolutely industry great this of
 course can be better if your iterative process is is you know thorough enough you start testing
 enough and you combine as many indicators as you can volatility is a very very very strong
 improvement over the volatility from the benchmark trades are very sufficient that's about five six
 per year yeah win rate to be fair could be slightly higher but uh profit factor strong uh and that uh
 actually I think these metrics I had them somewhere better but whatever this is a this is one of those
 uh uh examples that um I can give right now uh I'm going to be doing more case studies where I would
 want to improve this win rate to be honest but the sharp ratio at least is pretty strong uh
 the win rate in this case I would be improving by uh you know uh changing around the grid searches
 now uh honestly this I would not bring to production because the win rate here is too low
 and this would then uh be am I on the right asset here though yes yes I am sorry um so this would
 not be brought to production by me though the profit factor is still sufficiently strong but
 this would cost me to go back into the reiterative process so it's actually pretty good to show kind
 of a mistake I would ideally maybe want to improve the volatility but this is a case of where uh I
 think the sharp ratio is very good certaina ratio is very good max drawdown strong enough okay like
 this is crypto you have to be realistic maybe try to lower this to about 30 but um it's still good
 enough where you know it's still 50 lower than uh the the original uh it's strong but this win rate
 I would want it up so you have to go back maybe re-grid search um if possible you could even uh try to
 because this is something you have to start getting creative about right um if the win rate isn't
 strong enough look at the underlying TI's and decide okay I am not happy with this win rate
 because I want it to be at least 47.5 for me to be comfortable with or at least 50 or 55
 personally I like to shoot for about 50 I think that's pretty strong have a sharpie of 1.5 have it
 perform out of sample adequately well of course um you can start looking at the underlying statistics
 and then you can kind of uh you know be a doctor about it be surgical which one of the two is not
 giving me enough win rate now then you can do actually do something very simple you could uh
 remodule the notebook to optimize for uh more uh consistent trades so then the correction that will
 happen in its final form will be that one of the TI's will pick more consistently winning trades
 right because maybe the the entry and exit signals are now uh treating the data to have maybe a higher
 profit factor to take you know more ballsy trades but have a lower casino factor right and we don't
 want to have this low of a win rate going into the future right because we want it to generalize
 well that's why we need strong heuristics we want a high average win rate so that there's room for
 it to decay and yes this can happen though I would say because uh the the the larger your split is
 and the the shorter your training duration the more robust it's going to be but you still want it to
 have uh basically uh metrics that shoot for the stars land halfway below uh that are so so so strong
 but yet robust that you have such a strong generalizing ability to basically go 10 down
 but still do very well in the future that
