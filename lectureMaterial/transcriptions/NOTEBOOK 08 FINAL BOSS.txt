 Welcome guys to my most long-awaiting amalgamation of material I would say.
 This will be basically the final chapter of what was the bootcamp right?
 The bootcamp very much is just practical steps right? Like you may have noticed
 it's a little short or whatever but that's because it's just direct steps of
 a system that I've ran for years and it's just direct do this do this you know
 it's very to the point that's kind of the nature of it right because that's
 just the exact steps that I took to run a system for three years. Now then I made
 the lecture the first one about managing a quantitative portfolio but it was
 purely theoretical of course which is you know maybe a little bit impractical
 what do you do with it now that's where this video should come in obviously I
 have to work on a system but refine it a bit etc to get to a point of where I
 can showcase certain things and where you can actually draw the conclusion and
 maybe have some more framework to go by which is what you know I'm obviously
 going to highlight right now haha you may have seen them screenshots it's
 looking pretty good it's like a concoction of theory that I had for a
 very long time so I'm gonna break that down basically and how you put it all
 together at the end of the bootcamp is that you have a vague idea of how to
 construct maybe one or two of these like what I laid out to get a triple
 exponential moving average and a magdi right because those at least from my
 experience have worked very well you know obviously I also just recently
 released six videos more to come obviously depending on when you're
 watching this or whatever but about answers to prices of dry drivers of
 price right so that's again you know more theory but that's also like a thing
 that I'm sharing because I'm trying to answer certain retail trading questions
 and actionable frameworks now obviously I'm a one person so it's not like I
 tested every indicator under the Sun I'd love to do that but we all have our
 schedules I laid out triple EMA and map the because I know they work fairly well
 on those sentiment strong assets right when they're not sentimentally
 sentimentally strong momentum effect has less auto correlation and you get into
 these side zones where some of the automatic mistakes of indicators can
 happen like false signals they may deem the regime to be up but it's not
 measuring the severity of regime so you can make that stronger by putting
 algorithms together because obviously they're all in a sense uncorrelated so
 when one has a stronger trend and one has a weaker trend they're obviously still
 going to have a middle line in between them right that's why mixing bots and
 using them in combination has a much stronger sharp ratio when you put them
 together when you make them and they're uncorrelated enough in a normal
 financial traditional finance sense they're also stronger together because
 if one goes up one goes down other way around I mean then you get the middle
 line and you have an average right and if your theory and your stocks are strong
 enough that line should at least be you know above at least the zero line
 meaning that in general you should be gaining money now traditional finance
 eventually they put together the efficiency frontier the efficiency
 frontier is one that I showcased earlier I believe and the efficiency frontier is
 something that looks like this right it takes all your assets all your return
 curves plots them essentially along this line and finds you the portfolio
 collection that has the highest sharp ratio right with the point of
 diversification right because if one is much more volatile doesn't return as
 much it's going to get a slower allocation so because obviously the
 return and volatility which amalgamates sharp ratio in its formula they will
 give more or less percent to a certain asset to achieve the highest possible
 sharp ratio which I will show off in a sense but to tell you and how to improve
 upon that because in my opinion at least the efficient frontier is something
 that's inherently kind of an overfit concept because you're fitting it to a
 sharp but it's based on history right so it's fitting a curve quite literally I
 mean they call it the efficient frontier it's a curve here this line plots
 different sharp ratios like portfolio a has sharp ratio this portfolio be a
 sharp ratio that so how do you dynamically change these things around
 now an efficiency frontier like here will give you certain allocations right
 it will put together the individual sharp ratios so this one's gold and of
 course the S-Po one has a certain sharp ratio the Nasdaq has a certain sharp
 ratio Solana triple Nasdaq Bitcoin they all have certain sharp ratios now it's
 going to be giving each one of those assets a certain percentage right so
 the gold will have like I don't know 30 because it's like safe now Bitcoin
 obviously is higher so it's going to give it three because together put
 together they all in the individual sharp ratios like X you know like X this
 3% put together of course to a full of 100% allocation of portfolio will give
 you an amalgamated aggregated sharp ratio which is then your highest possible to
 achieve obviously you could also you know divide them by mean like let's say you
 have these six obviously it's going to be a hundred divided by six but that's
 obviously not going to be the strongest sharp ratio if you're going to calculate
 these all together that's where something like an efficiency frontier is very
 useful but that would still not answer questions of like which asset is trending
 the strongest and I've quoted this paper a bunch of times but in the ranked
 asset allocation model which is in essence just a dynamic reallocation of
 rank by month which is in a sense is just a ranking depending on a periodic
 reallocation like a reshuffle of all the assets is a cross sectional
 momentum model meaning cross sectional meaning across different sections in
 this sense you can measure the underlying momentum of these assets to kind of
 catch certain assets trajectories in relativity right the cross sectionality
 happens by relatively comparing different assets which they do in the ranked
 asset allocation model in the ranked asset allocation model they are
 comparing the momentum scores of the 12th portfolio which is like a large cap
 mid cap small cap I think this is international emerging markets like
 Dow Jones commodities materials right they're tracking the relative momentum
 scores of these assets to always be allocated to the best one you also have
 from the same author the anti-fragility asset allocation model where they're
 measuring different sectors of the SMB like financials industrials
 communications, technology blah blah blah and in an anti-fragility asset
 allocation model they often quote or note they quote Nassim Talib which is a guy
 that you know work with the fat tails where you try to prevent black swan
 events right because if the momentum in financials is higher but tech is about
 to have a crash obviously they have negative momentum and if they are a
 negative momentum obviously it's a downtrend and you probably don't want to
 be in there in a position or you want to be shorting it now the big downside of
 this is that momentum and stuff the of these underlying assets are not
 optimized at all so the basic premise is that if you put one and two together
 which is much like the ensemble theory that I've been quoting a lot where you
 try to catch different drivers of price right
 you can also in a way cross and mix match perhaps the relative
 consectional momentum like they do in the ranked asset allocation model but you
 can also do it by comparing the different assets to each other so what I've
 done in what I believe is a super strong approach to retail quanting at least
 and should also you know hold true in a lot of other aspects if you do go into
 a job it's at least an interesting approach do believe that quant finance is
 a very how do you say it dynamic industry right like the thing is that
 there's a million answers you know there's people that go on one hour time
 frames on two hour time frames that there's not one universal answer at all
 so by all means try to find something else this is what I've conducted and the
 sharp ratio is pretty good if I say so myself right so basically these
 individual algorithms are obviously very good for one asset why I mean in the
 sense that when I want to compare the relative strength of all is that I
 start comparing all six right so you have a measure for one asset and you have a
 measure for all six which then if you let's say like in the around asset
 allocation model you assess yourself to be in the best x you know like the top
 end of this which they do in the ranked asset allocation model they only hold
 the strongest risers the lowest correlators in this case I'm only doing
 momentum by the way but that's besides the point but if you put that together
 you can in a sense without directly addressing it like I'm suggesting you
 do with superior modeling than just using a 3ma or a macd you can also
 address it by just always being in the strongest riser but that is also decided
 by its at least its individual algo to be in an uptrend so you in a sense kind
 of put together in confidence and in parsimony you put together two strong
 strategies that have worked because the ranked asset allocation model has
 actually won a price the anti-frigility asset allocation model has also won a
 price I've run these different algos for years right their sharps are already
 strong they are not like something that can overfit it's just putting two things
 together because you're going to be hedging yourself against the downturns
 which is well documented and has won the price you know these people have one
 monthly you know so the peer review at least has been conducted in a sense and
 put that together with something like I'm suggesting which you in the bootcamp
 and arguably you could achieve a higher ratio which I'm going to show you now
 fun fact right but that's the basic theory you could also do an efficient
 frontier it's much faster to do but because the efficient frontier is purely
 back-looking right it's based on history and it's what I did here this is like
 basically kind of a curve fit to the perfect allocation that you should have
 had but this is an optimization based on like five years of data so why do I
 know that gold is this okay maybe but it gives you a good reflection on what
 could have been the price action that you could have you know had given you were
 there from the start I guess if you will now to also tell you when you start
 putting down the bootcamp stuff this is basically how much notebooks I was
 working with right like I was testing Google I was testing Meta I was testing
 the semiconductors that I was slapping more indicators over assets than
 putting indicators on assets themselves right so I was slapping indicators like
 that's where my rotation was in a sense right because you can much like I'm
 suggesting you do make these different algorithms better by using different
 indicators which a lot of people in school are doing which is super cool by
 the way you should definitely do that which can give them better answers to
 mean reverting actions but this these are things that I address more in that
 section of the course I'm gonna keep that short but arguably if you use
 something that's not only a trend indicator like a triple EMA or a MACD
 you should be able to address mean reverting or choppy action better because
 you are using indicators that are more tuned for this right they're addressing
 one of those different drivers of price action very much right so another way to
 do that of course is by having different indicators that obviously are
 uncorrelated and by having their relative in at least in accordance to
 each other momentum addressed you will always be in a stronger trend right so
 you have one asset that just has to go you know basically long and then at least
 if you have a score that's also comparing 3 4 5 and that's keeping score like
 oh this one's maybe the second this one's the first score then at least the
 top two ones are going to be in a great trend at least in the relative market
 sense because they have been compared over the whole portfolio but they're
 not comparing to you know the other you know they're only comparing to their own
 price data but this will also give you a measure of the whole portfolio together
 which gives you a lot more robustness to because if one algorithm is under
 performing the other one can pick it up which is a very simple concept but it's
 only going to net you very well in the long run and it's also what you will see
 in the sharp ratio that I'm about to show you so to get to the beginning of
 the notebook but but but but but but but yeah it's a scroll right so here I am
 is okay so getting to the top okay but but but but but but by RSI and RVI that
 that the okay so here I imported the notebooks yes okay so what you see here
 is obviously the bum fuck of a of a folder that I had right obviously this
 is me working it's very chaotic like what the hell is going on in this file
 structure I'll show you shortly here I for example I'll just take the SPX house
 an example I obviously gave you the three main notebook I optimized I also ran
 on a rune and a magdi I then ensembled the best combination the ones that I
 found to be most fit for this purpose right the ones that were very much the
 best at that particular case with the indicators used could you improve them
 if you use different indicators fuck yeah please improve me I'd love to see it
 it's just that this work for me in this particular time I'm educating more than
 I'm modeling because you know I'm doing two things at the same time it's a lot
 of work but yeah you could improve you could you find a better indicator than
 MacD and TMA triple MA yeah you could just this is what worked for me in the
 time and was the most is like the most pragmatic solution for me in time as I'm
 doing like what for different side projects working on a lot of stuff you'll
 love it just wait and see but this is what worked for me in time so these were
 the best indicators for me right now okay so don't take this as like the the
 magnum opus I made no I could have spent probably three more months modeling
 but it's the result is very good because all of these are a sharp ratio of give
 or take 1.5 it also depends on acid by the way like Solana gives you a very
 very very high sharp ratio but if you put that together and you start comparing
 the actual volatility to each other and the sharp ratio of let's say something
 safer like the S&P will have a lower sharp but also much lower volatility
 which is something that gets put to light when you you know use the efficient
 frontier because it's going to be holding a lot of gold right so if you put
 them together it's going to actually put use a lot of more less Solana unless
 you obviously try to optimize with the efficient frontier for returns then
 obviously Solana is going to get a much bigger allocation in that sense because
 it gets weighed up but if you're optimizing for sharp much like I in the
 ranked asset allocation model you're doing a relative momentum if you're
 doing a relativity measure for returns obviously something like crypto is going
 to get a bigger allocation but if you're optimizing for a sharp ratio
 obviously something safe like gold is going to get a lot more attention from
 this right so I put it all together blah blah blah I took it from my folders
 yada yada yada here I imported the datasets are as follows right I have the
 time series so I can merge them you know like a join I have positions right so
 zero is just flat I'm not selling I am out of the money I'm doing nothing then
 you have the strategy return and the underlying buying hold return which is
 very important for the relative measure right I'm not measuring strategies in
 relativity to each other I'm measuring the returns of them all together here I'm
 joining I'm plotting a little correlation matrix not that important
 honestly here I have another one here you do see by the way that buying hold
 correlations they change right and here I just plot it again just for good
 measure but it changes not that important honestly to cover and I would be
 wasting more time than needed what I do here and this is a key point I am
 computing an RSI for 28 periods I'm not doing 14 because I believe a slightly
 longer look back is going to give better smoothed values but in turn RSI is my
 current choice for a momentum measure right so this is what I'm going to be
 measuring the cross-sectional momentum with right like what they do in the
 ranked asset allocation model they use absolute momentum which is previous end
 close compared to today's end percentage difference RSI is average
 percentage gain divided by average percentage loss I have tested ranked
 allocation model a lot and I found the RSI to be slightly better obviously it's
 still very simple it has only one parameter like the end look back but I
 believe it to be the most sound version for me specifically in this case because
 this is what I've tested and it gave me better scores so that's what I'm using
 you are free to use anything else by the way you can use maybe even a flat range
 with an MA that might work better for you who knows who knows right I guys I've
 been preaching this for a while but the concept of doing the throw it at the wall
 see what sticks I I'm a firm believer right if it was possibly to be a
 missionary for something I would be a missionary for that thing it nothing is
 set in stone right it's all just a different interpretation of a data
 value giving you a different output it's very dynamic there is no engineering
 here it's very much even a little bit artistic so here I start ranking so why
 am I ranking if you read the ranked allocation model paper maybe it's better
 to understand this in a deeper sense you might have to but that's what I did in
 this case yada yada yada might be useful to read to understand it but I'll try to
 explain it shortly here so basically the RSI obviously is a normalization of the
 values you know you have the average gain of the underlying and it's of the
 buy and hold just to remember you right this is not of the strategies that you
 make in the bootcamp but this is the highest a highest average gain like
 average gain I'm not sorry that it's not the highest average again it's the average
 gain divided by the average loss which is obviously going to create a value
 between zero and 100 because it's this one this is one of those bounded
 indicators now what I plotted is not a buy or hold or something at 1730 which
 is more typical with the RSI I plotted it to it to be right in the middle because
 the point of this is to start comparing I want a relative measure of all the
 momentum at these places in time and I want them to be above 50 at least one
 of the most critical things they did in the ranked asset allocation model and in
 the anti fragility asset allocation model is that if the momentum was below
 zero which is their middle line right because it's either because it's an
 it's a percentage change right you have because it's the close of current
 compared to the close of you know like let's say 30 days ago you know compared
 to n ago there's obviously a middle line at zero this one normalizes between a
 zero and 100 so obviously the middle line is at 50 but given that and the
 biggest effect that the ranked asset allocation model has aside from being a
 good relative measure is that they have sort of a mask they have a hedge that if
 momentum goes below a certain line if it goes negative you go out of the
 position and this allowed them to actually hedge for the giant giant black
 swan in 2008 so if you have your own the like the discrete algorithm for one
 asset for one return curve but you also have it in relativity and both of them
 are essentially just risk reduction measures for black swans and you put
 both of them together in two by rules because the only thing you're doing here
 is adding a by rule for a portfolio and buying a poor by rule for an asset if you
 put both of them together your risk adjusted metrics become so good and you
 will see it in a second it becomes extremely good because you've seen it
 and it's proofs in the pudding here and I'll show you for a second right like
 this one on gold do you see how little this max drawdown is that's 7% that's
 also in the efficient frontier if you paid attention a second ago why when it
 optimizes for sharp that it allocates like 45% of it why it's just that damn
 good but if you then also add the ranked asset allocations magic of when
 there's a negative trend and at least in this case it's measuring that in
 relativity right so it's sorting it's shoveling through all these assets
 because it ranking them consistently per month yada yada yada then you can have
 two extremely good risk managing rules that will help you be in a better
 position parody much at all time but by putting them together you can create
 confidence by measuring one asset and also all assets together which turns
 just one strategy or something not as refined into a great portfolio management
 strategy with not even that difficult of numbers and you will see that the
 sharp ratio really improves right so here you can see through the time series
 would plotted by like till 60 here let me let's make this a scroll element right
 that it's ranking by day right so here you have the Solana rank the Nasdaq
 rank the Apple rank and the this is a semiconductors from funnec so rank to
 blah blah blah it keeps starting it's keep sorting right and I made it to be
 zero because you see that right there right so you might be thinking like
 why is it zero I made it zero if it's below 50 right so I'm making a ranking
 system I'm making a time series I'm plotting it across all strategies and
 when it's zero I wanted to be out like that's my one exit rule if it's not
 there I'm not going to be looking at the bootcamp strategy I'm not going to even
 care about it right and that's something I put into the logic later as well okay
 so here I'm John joining I'm ranking on on the dates and there I'm joining and
 ranking the ranking the F in the strategy F on on the one value and here you see
 the time dates blah blah blah the returns yeah they are the other extract
 here I'm defining that I want to be holding the top four I'm working with I
 believe it assets and one thing and a measure that I took from the optimization
 right I want to have a safe haven haven asset right because the logic of
 courses in the ranked asset allocation model that I'm only going to be holding
 top and assets right I took four because that gives me a nice spread it's like
 25 per but what if my top and is not there what if all my underlying
 discrete algorithms the ones that I made in the bootcamp are all exited well then
 I want a safe haven asset like gold right I wanted to be in gold so sometimes
 you'll see and you'll see it in a second that maybe 50 to 75 percent gets
 allocated to gold right that's something I did very did it I did it
 intentionally because this is my safest asset you saw it max drawdown seven so
 if nothing is decided by my indicator algo from the bootcamp or by the RSI to
 be actually good to hold like to actually have a strong trend then I don't
 want it I just don't want it I swipe left right I sound like a fucking retard
 right okay so this is the biggest logic and I'm going to have to explain it here
 here it starts allocating right and you see a few statistics right like
 days in cash one six three days of partial allocation so not like four in you
 know no top four held so 463 full allocation 826 allocation changes 416
 days with gold 467 you obviously see there's a lot of gold happening yeah
 okay so here I started checking the logic a bit because obviously when you
 start constructing like a big chain of decisions of what to hold you want to
 you know sample what you're doing this is also really what you should be doing
 when you are managing your portfolio but yeah okay so here it gives you
 partial allocation why gold is one position is zero so my safe haven asset
 that I wanted there to be as backup you know like it's your backup it's not on
 that it's deemed to be because this position one is the one from the
 underlying strategy it's not fit to be an uptrend so I wanted to go to zero gold
 is not being held because it's decided to be zero by its discreet algo it is
 however ranked one apparently but it doesn't matter right because the buy
 rules here are very much yes and yes then I enter and if it's not I wanted to be
 out the only exception of course is that I have my safe haven asset which I want
 to be held if possible at all times because I would rather be in a position
 and be in a market than not be right I don't like being in cash because I
 won't make money basically SPY is deemed to be long and is a position 3
 there's Apple at position 1 and it's 25% then here I'm also sanity checking
 nothing is deemed to be positive but the discrete algos are so what happens here
 of course is that you start seeing the magic happen the whole market apparently
 is in a downtrend but these algos are flipping green respectively but that
 doesn't mean that the relative market or the overall macro economy is good so I
 am at zero and this is actually one of the worst years as you'll see when you
 back test right here one two one okay so I'm selecting top four of course though
 this one's zero so you see that it flips to gold right so the discrete algo is
 actually telling me not to hold a whole apple but my relative one says it's
 alright I get like I can't hold Apple of course because it's
 persisted to be zero so in that case I just go to gold because it's my safe
 asset right which was also decided by the optimization frontier and also to be
 fair if you have common sense you would know that gold is pretty safe to hold
 of course so here obviously one one four one three one two one okay you know
 then it holds all four perfectly fine one one four one two one three one now
 perfect allocation again so here again the summary allocation changes for 16
 days would go to the here you have a ticker participation here of course max
 weight is a hundred because I assigned it to be my safe haven asset but you can
 switch that out you know like you can also try to have it be on NASDAQ if you
 have a super good NASDAQ algo maybe you wanted to be the S&P maybe even you want
 to go short you know if the whole economy is in is in fire why don't why not
 go short you know you could do short I generally don't advise going short but
 you know you're free to try by the way you know I'm trying to encourage
 creativity and I'm just throwing ideas at people but you're free to do it so
 verify weights blah blah blah blah weight statistics expected total blah
 blah DQQ days in here you just see kind of a division of like how much was
 approximately held this one okay days six on four that the that that you know
 that's all good not too interesting actual mean blah blah blah it was just
 another send the G check for me to of course make sure that the actual gold
 book makes sense notebook makes sense here you kind of see like a returns per
 day yada yada yada comprehensive back test here I start a integrating vector
 BT blah blah blah blah here a lot a lot a lot a lot a lot a lot a lot a lot a lot
 you can see it's a lot of metrics a lot of visuals but you know I think it's cool
 right so commission was 0.1 total of commission paid is 9.1 number of
 rebalances again 416 average commission the the annualized sharp came to be this
 not that great to look at let's look at the visual okay so this is probably what
 you may have seen given you were paying attention to the discord this weekend
 total return this is by the way over five years okay so because I plotted
 Solana here Solana didn't really have much data at least from Y finance before
 2020 so obviously this is cut off but if you know and watch the bootcamp you know
 that anything before was training data so you know who gives it down really okay
 you see a pretty good equity curve it's flat here and this is 2022 and if you
 remember 2022 you know it was not a good trading here then it slowly goes up and
 this is then actually all out of sample so very much you could just you know
 forget what the fuck is going on here this is all out of sample data so you
 really see how strong these two become in relativity to each other right sharp
 extremely high none of the underlying assets are actually above like one I
 believe my Solanas 1.8 my NASDAQ is 1.6 my Bitcoins 1.41 my TQQ is like 1.46 you
 know that those are very good sharp ratios like by all means because these
 are very much benchmarks of their underlying assets you know like Bitcoin
 you could consider it an ETF very much because it holds like the largest
 market cap and it's the first thing that has inflows of money when entering the
 market so you could consider it an ETF you could literally just trade off one of
 those algos that's actually what I did for a super long time but when you put
 them together and this is also why like if you start modeling and I recommended
 it to another guy I would give it as an advice in general but once you start
 just combining like different elements of things like if that be an indicator if
 that be you know in an ensemble sense if that be like a portfolio where
 anything can start becoming uncorrelated but if you put a view uncorrelated
 super strong algorithms together you start seeing what happens right like I'm
 measuring in relativity and with the cross-sectional momentum measure of an
 RSI that I'm giving it a score I'm just rotating through them right and they
 rotate every time a change happens and then you know they start having a lot
 of confluence together and the effect is just absolutely exponential because by
 rotating and having those two let's say black swan or risk reducing measures
 improving risk adjusted metrics Rick big big Rick rap okay cringe okay dude but
 by adding those two together you can see that the max drawdown becomes super
 good right because the discrete algo is super good at the respective price data
 of that one return curve but it's not great at measuring the overall economy
 because it's not because it's not measuring that right because the sharp
 ratio on the Solana might look higher but that doesn't mean it's necessarily
 losing less because the volatility is still divided by like you know return
 divided by full it volatility it's just in respect of that assets price data in
 this sense I'm putting two great measures together which is that relative
 ranking and the discrete algorithm for one asset so you can see how by rotating
 through them and taking some good spice from one place and taking good spice
 from another you create this amazing parsimony where the max drawdown really
 is just 13% right and the sharp ratio is insanely high and the Sartino ratio is
 incredibly high cagger okay look this is not like Renaissance you know this is
 the five years this is not 30 years running but the cagger is extremely
 positive and both systems are very robust because a relative measure to exit
 below 50 at every change of trade from underlying assets in top end is not
 something that is overfit in any sense because we already did on every asset
 we already did three years of out of sample running now we're just putting
 them together so they can correct each other much like the ensemble it's just
 gonna exit and give you more spread this is not overfitting this is
 diversification which creates a super robust portfolio I have zero problems
 running my entire portfolio amount of money on this right now and I'm gonna
 I'm gonna do that of course this has been a baby I've been sitting on for years
 now I executed because you know I actually have some damn free time being at
 the bank all the time isn't actually that fun it's not it's not okay but this
 is the result of me just thinking about it for a while right and you can see
 that it works because you are just diversifying you're just doing an
 extra measure the ranked asset allocation model is very strong there's
 multiple papers of the same methodology just ping me up I can find you like five
 there's been even a paper with a decade of documenting these these relative
 systems it's super strong there's super super amounts of verification on a
 citation basis basis for them putting them together like having a
 specialized measure for one asset with a relative measure just really works if
 you can set this up you're set for life you you can cancel the school don't
 please I want to make more for you guys please but you could in hypothetical
 sense like this is so much better than buying holding any asset here you can
 see how you know low and limited days really are I do believe I have another
 print here you can see like kind of the the performance by year right so if I
 make this scrollable for a second blah blah blah return here you can obviously
 see that 2022 was a bit shit right but you can also see full allocation it was
 not allocated all the time right so it was in cash which is this measure 55%
 of the time which means because in the beginning of 2022 there's a big big
 dip right so you had the big deep and we went all to cash because the relative
 measure for the whole economy basically said yo this sucks our size below 50
 we're not gonna do this so it was literally just flat for most of the year
 but hey that's a whole lot better than losing money now you could you know maybe
 in this case of short look at how little happens here you know not being in a
 position not losing money is actually secretly winning you money because
 nothing in this school that I'm telling you is helping you make more returns
 it's just stopping you from losing money which in turn earns you money like if
 you focus that mind the setting shift chasing trying to chase returns and
 trying to just chase like risk adjusted metrics you'll actually end up making a
 whole lot more money fun fact right and then these three are all full out of
 sample you can see the returns obviously 2025 isn't completely close yet return
 28% 38% 84% now that's phenomenal beats the market by a long shot of course
 if you have been looking at charts for a while you know here you see the final
 allocation obviously 33.5% okay this these calculations are completely
 correct by the way but it's in their relative sense okay because it's measured
 like this so max weight 100 of course average one health 45% so a lot higher
 of course it's just science it's just making sure all the calculations are
 correct allocation distribution who cares who cares who cares
 what's down here per asset okay this is all not that interesting I'm just gonna
 show you the optimized portfolio for a second obviously like I've been saying
 if you were chasing returns Bitcoin and stuff would have been a lot higher gold
 obviously being the safest asset is very high even in an overfit sense like
 kind of like an optimization is the sharp ratio is not that much higher like I
 said if you're chasing returns Solana you know if you're gonna optimize a
 portfolio for anything but a sharp ratio like returns or max drawdowns or
 something of the sort if you're gonna minimize drawdowns it's obviously also
 going to hold a lot of gold if you're gonna be chasing returns it's going to
 allocate a lot more to crypto here you see you know this kind of these I'll
 deal eyes measures so you know what it very much is also that if you put the
 optimization on top of your notebook it's going to give you the most realistic
 outcome right so you have a kind of a nothing not even an overfit but it's
 going to give you the most ideal scenario which is not overfit that you
 could you know strive to have because it gives you the most ideal allocation
 over all this time if you take and optimize for a sharp value sharp ratio
 it's obviously going to prefer and prioritize a very you know efficient
 risk-adjusted metric allocation assortment for you and that means that
 if your highest allocated one in maybe your respective portfolio is maybe
 Nasdaq or I don't know what what what would it be like T bills I don't know
 for you know who the fuck models T bills but maybe you're modeling T bills it's
 going to give that to that particular asset and it's going to get the largest
 percentage because it's you know kind of compensating for all these crazy other
 assets that might not have as great of a sharp ratio in the relative sense
 running sharp really good and this is all pretty comparable to the moment
 model above which means you succeeded by the way here it means that if you were
 never shorting in this time it means you were not gonna do it this is the year
 2022 2022 2022 simply sucked if you had intraday bots in this year you would
 have performed obviously much better swing trading is the only downside of
 swing trading is that you're still very married to external factors while
 intraday bots are more consistent but again much harder to model I believe I
 have said that a few times this one is kind of cool optimizes for the Omega and
 you will see that the Omega is much higher sharp ratio slightly lower but the
 returns are much higher so it just gives you a different idea right like it here
 Omega obviously is a bit more for the returns you know it's it's got a
 different calculation and you can see that it starts allocating a lot more to
 Solana Solana is obviously a very very very juicy asset that's gonna give you a
 lot of money and you can see that the allocation is much higher like I said
 right now you know the obviously the max drawdown becomes much higher but it's
 all about how you model it right but again nothing in 2022 that's the one
 downside of swing trading you could be flat for a whole year so that's the
 basic thing if this was long so I'm gonna cut it off here and stop rambling
 but if you have any questions please please please shoot me an answer if
 people want the notebook ask I try to encourage people to kind of you know try
 and do this themselves
